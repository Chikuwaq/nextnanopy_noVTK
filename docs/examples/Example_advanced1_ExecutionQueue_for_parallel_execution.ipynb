    "\n",
    "In Example 4: Use Sweep to automate execution it is shown how to run few input files simultaneously using nextnanopy.Sweep.execute_sweep(parallel_limit = n). Implementation of the parallelization is based on thread like object nextanopy.inputs.ExecutionQueue. This example shows how to use this object directly to parallel several simulations at a time if your goal doesn't fall under Sweep \n",

    "ExecutionQueue class inherits from threading.thread class. To learn more about threading visit https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html . \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is following: InputFile objects can be added to waiting queue (ExecutionQueue.waiting_queue). On run, InputFiles from queue is executed and added to execution pool (ExecutionQueue.started) until it is full. Whenever some simulations are finished, new InputFile is poped from waiting queue. \n",
